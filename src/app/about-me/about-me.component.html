    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Govarthana Rao. I have completed my higher education in Bachelor of Engineering specializing in Mechanical Engineering in 2019. I worked for more than two years in Mechanical industries dealing with foreign clients, handling projects, which greatly helped in improving my communication skills and working with a team. Throughout my academics and career, I have maintained my interest and kept learning coding languages. I was always fascinated working with coding languages and went through an six month intensive training for Java Full Stack Development. I specialize in React, Angular, Node js, Springboot, Java, Python, Css, JS and MySQL. Through the knowledge gained through the intensive training and self-learing, I was able to develop two projects, Techie a quiz app bult using React, Nodejs with Express and MySQL and the very thing you are viewing, the portfolio site is built using Angular, CSS and Typescript. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and work with like minded individuals. </p>
